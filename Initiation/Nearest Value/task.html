<h2>Nearest Value</h2>
<!-- Describe task in general -->
<p>
 Find the nearest value to the given one.
</p>
<p>
 You are given a set of integers
    and a value for which you need to find the nearest one.
</p>
<p>
 For example, we have the following sequence of numbers: 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 17,
    and we need to find the nearest value to the number 9. If we sort this sequence
    in the ascending order, then to the left of number 9 will be number 7 and to
    the right - will be number 10. But 10 is closer than 7, which means that the correct answer is 10.
</p>
<p>
 A few clarifications:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  If 2 numbers are at the same distance, you need to choose the smallest one;
 </li>
 <li>
  The sequence of numbers is always non-empty;
 </li>
 <li>
  The given value can be in this sequence, which means that it’s the answer;
 </li>
 <li>
  The sequence may contain both positive and negative numbers, but they are always integers;
 </li>
 <li>
  The sequence isn’t sorted and consists only unique numbers.
 </li>
</ul>
