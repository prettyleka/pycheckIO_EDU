<h2>Days Between</h2>
<p>
 How old are you in a number of days? It's easy to calculate - just subtract your birthday from today. We could make
    this a real challenge though and count the difference between any dates.
</p>
<p>
 You are given two dates as an tuple with three numbers - a year, month and day. For example: 19 April 1982 will be
    (1982, 4, 19). You should find the difference in days between the given dates. For example between today and
    tomorrow = 1 day. The difference will always be either a positive number or zero, so don't forget about the absolute
    value.

 <strong>
  Input:
 </strong>
 Two dates as tuples of integers.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Output:
 </strong>
 The difference between the dates in days as an integer.

 <pre class="brush: python">assert days_diff((1982, 4, 19), (1982, 4, 22)) == 3
assert days_diff((2014, 1, 1), (2014, 8, 27)) == 238
assert days_diff((2014, 8, 27), (2014, 1, 1)) == 238

  How it is used:
 </strong>
 Python has batteries included, so in this mission you’ll need to learn how to use completed modules so that you
    don't have to invent the bicycle all over again.
