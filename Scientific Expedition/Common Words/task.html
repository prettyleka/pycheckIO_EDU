<p>
 Let's continue examining words. You are given two strings with words separated by commas.
    Try to find what is common between these strings. The words in the same string don't repeat.
</p>
<p>
 Your function should find all of the words that appear in both strings.
    The result must be represented as a string of words separated by commas in
 <strong>
  alphabetic order.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Input:
 </strong>
 Two arguments as strings.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Output:
 </strong>
 The common words as a string.
</p>

  <strong>
   Example:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <pre class="brush: python">assert checkio(&quot;hello,world&quot;, &quot;hello,earth&quot;) == &quot;hello&quot;
assert checkio(&quot;one,two,three&quot;, &quot;four,five,six&quot;) == &quot;&quot;
assert checkio(&quot;one,two,three&quot;, &quot;four,five,one,two,six,three&quot;) == &quot;one,three,two&quot;
</pre>
</div>

 <strong>
  How it is used:
 </strong>
 Here you can learn how to work with strings and sets.
    This knowledge can be useful for linguistic analysis.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Precondition:
 </strong>
 <br/>
 Each string contains no more than 10 words.
 <br/>
 All words separated by commas.
 <br/>
 All words consist of lowercase latin letters.
